# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a simple, single-page, React-based application which permits you to create, edit, and delete appointments across various days (Mon - Fri). The use of PSQL also ensures that the appointments you generate persist across various sessions. On this topic, note that you will need to run both the PSQL server and the React-application concurrently in order for this app to function correctly. This is my first take at building a React-based project and I hope you enjoy my work!
